This is the repo for the code test.
It's started with nextjs with tailwindcss and typescript.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the demo page.
## Components

The needed component is finished in the `components` folder. You can see the details of the component in it, while the types are defined in the `types` folder, and since the component is controllable, I write a hooks about controllable value in the `hooks` folder.
